        <h2>Understanding Hypertension</h2>

        <h3>What Is Hypertension?</h3>
        <p>
            Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. 
            Over time, this pressure can damage your blood vessels and increase the risk of serious health problems like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
            You might not feel any different—even with dangerously high blood pressure. 
            That’s why hypertension is often called the "silent killer." Left unmanaged, it can quietly harm your body for years before symptoms appear. By the time you notice signs like headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath, damage may already be underway.
        </p>

        <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
        <p>Several factors can contribute to hypertension:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics</strong>: A family history increases your risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Age</strong>: Blood pressure tends to rise as you get older.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol can raise your blood pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Other conditions</strong>: Diabetes, kidney disease, and stress also play a role.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prevention and Management</h3>
        <p>The good news? Hypertension can often be prevented or managed through simple lifestyle changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eat heart-healthy</strong>: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-sodium foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay active</strong>: Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage stress</strong>: Practice deep breathing, mindfulness, or journaling.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit alcohol and avoid smoking.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Monitor your blood pressure regularly.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In some cases, medication prescribed by a doctor may also be necessary.</p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding hypertension is the first step toward preventing it. Don’t wait for symptoms—check your blood pressure, prioritize your health, and make choices today that your future self will thank you for.
