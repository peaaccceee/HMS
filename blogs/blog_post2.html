        <h2>5 Tips to Boost Your Immune System</h2>

        <p>
            Your immune system is your body’s natural defense against illness. While no single habit can guarantee you won’t get sick, strengthening your immunity helps your body fight off infections more effectively and recover faster. Here are five practical tips to help you stay strong and healthy:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Eat a Balanced, Nutrient-Rich Diet</h3>
        <p>
            Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Vitamins and minerals—especially Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc—play a major role in supporting immune function.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Get Enough Quality Sleep</h3>
        <p>
            Your body repairs and regenerates while you sleep. Aim for 7–9 hours of restful sleep each night. Poor sleep can weaken your immune response, making you more vulnerable to illness.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Stay Physically Active</h3>
        <p>
            Regular exercise improves circulation and helps your immune cells move more efficiently throughout your body. Even moderate activity, like walking or stretching, can have a positive impact.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Manage Stress Effectively</h3>
        <p>
            Chronic stress can suppress your immune system. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature to stay emotionally balanced.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Stay Hydrated</h3>
        <p>
            Water supports all your body’s systems, including your immune response. Drinking enough fluids helps your body flush out toxins and carry nutrients to cells more effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taking care of your immune system is a daily commitment. Start with these small changes and stay consistent—you’ll not only feel better but also build your body’s natural resistance to illness over time.
